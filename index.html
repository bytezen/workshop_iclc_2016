# Make a Mini Live Coding Language

*International Live Coding Conference 2016, Hamilton, Canada*

> In this workshop participants will design and develop a idiosyncratic (perhaps even esoteric) language for live coding. Participants will use an open-source, browser-based code editor capable of communicating with a variety of audio platforms (such as the native browser audio API, Ableton Live, and Max/MSP). The workshop will give a gentle introduction to the construction of grammars for parsing, using friendly browser-based libraries, with which participants will design their own mini-languages for defining musical patterns. Participants will take turns experimenting with the other languages created in the workshop, obtaining feedback and inspiration from each other, and will leave with the knowledge required to continue development of their language on their own.

**Invent your own language!**

In this workshop participants will create their own, idiosyncratic (perhaps even esoteric) mini-languages for live coding. These languages will be designed and run in a readily-accessible browser-based code editor. The workshop will give a gentle introduction to the construction of languages via parsing expression grammars. No experience in any of these specific technologies is necessary. However, some programming experience will be helpful. An open-source browser-based editing environment and support library will be provided to participants. This environment leverages the codemirror and peg.js projects, and can dynamically evaluate code to communicate via websockets or OSC with a variety of platforms for generating audiovisual content. The workshop concentrates upon the editing, parsing, scheduling and annotation of live code within this environment, but examples will be worked through driving standalone engines including Max/MSP and Ableton Live (we will provide a standalone app for participants who do not have Live and Max), as well as addressing the Web Audio API (available in most modern browsers). Although participants will develop for the target of their choice many language features will be agnostic to the intended target platform. 

Time-permitting, language features explored in the workshop will include:
- Basic concepts of grammars: rules, literals, sequences, alternatives, actions, etc.
- Triggering code fragments
- Sequencing and the creation of patterns
- Pattern manipulation and transformation
- Modulation of properties using nested expressions
- Perhaps even self-modifying code

By the end of the workshop users will have created a small idiosyncratic (and perhaps esoteric) live-coding language capable of targeting a variety of platforms. We will reserve time for participants to experiment with other languages created in the workshop, so that they can obtain feedback and inspiration from each other. Participants will leave with the knowledge required to continue development of their language on their own.

## Intro



## Designing a language's grammar

Parsing is the general problem of turning raw text into structured data. 

The PEG.js library has an online grammar editor at http://pegjs.org/online

The simplest grammar is:

```peg
start = ""
```

This defines an initial rule called "start", which will match the input only if it is an empty string. 

Rules are specified as combinations (patterns) of other rules, and 'terminals', such as quoted strings. 

### Simple examples

Counting the number of words in a block of text:

```peg
// pattern: zero or more instances of a word followed by nonword characters
// action: return the number of instances found
wordcount = w:(word nonword)* { return w.length; }

// one or more letters:
word = [a-zA-Z]+

// zero or more characters, like spaces, full-stops, etc.
nonword = [^a-zA-Z]*
```

### Insights

Though a grammar is defined top-down, it's usually easier to build & think about bottom up. 

Sketching out a few examples of simple phrases or statements the grammar should understand (and what it should reject!) can help. 

You can also think about it in a modular way: what types of things can be plugged into others. E.g., for the form "A + B" you might think of being able to plug numbers, words, and parentheses clauses in, e.g. "a + 1", "x + (y + z)", etc. The rules of the grammar identify things that can be plugged in, and what can be plugged into them.

The core pattern concepts are "exactly this text", "a then b", "a or b", "optionally a", "zero or more a's", "one or more a's", "anything in the range of a to b", "anything except a", "anything that is also", etc. The most important 5 concepts, and how to write them, are:


Concept											| Syntax 
:--- 											| :---
Exactly the text "abc"							| ```"abc"```
A then B (sequence) 							| ```A B```
A or B (ordered choice) 						| ```A / B```
Optional A 										| ```A?```
Zero or more A's (returns an array)				| ```A*```
One or more A's (returns an array)				| ```A+```

These can of course be combined:

Concept											| Syntax 
:--- 											| :---
Match "ab", "aab", "aaab", etc.					| ```"a"+ "b"```
A list of zero or more A's and B's 				| ```(A / B)*```

There are also some special helpers that can make grammars a lot easier to write:

Concept 										| Syntax 
:--- 											| :---
Any integer 									| ```[0-9]```
Any lowercase letter 							| ```[a-z]```
Any uppercase letter 							| ```[A-Z]```
Any letter or number 							| ```[a-zA-Z0-9]```
Any non-letter 									| ```[^a-zA-Z]```
Any character at all (always matches)			| ```.```

Advanced: There are also a couple of "predicate" concepts, which test one pattern first (but do not advance the input, nor use the result), and then test the next one and use it. 

Concept 										| Syntax 
:--- 											| :---
A that also matches B (and-predicate) 			| ```&B A```
A that also does not match B (not-predicate) 	| ```!B A```
A (only when followed by B)			 			| ```A &(B)```
A (unless followed by B)					 	| ```A !(B)```

We make rules ("nonterminals") for several reasons:
- the same sub-pattern can reappear in many different locations
- to break up complex patterns into more digestible chunks, with helpful names
- to identify points in the grammar at which structure can change

*Choice is ordered*, which is important. If the first of a set of alternatives matches, the others will be ignored. It can be important therefore to list your alternatives with the most specific/complex first, the most general/simple last. As a simple example, ```"a" / "aa"``` will never select the second option, as the first one would have been valid. 

*Actions*: In most languages, correct syntax doesn't guarantee correct semantics. And in fact, quite often a lot of the syntax is irrelevant -- "var x" is the same as "var       x" in JavaScript, for example -- so frequently our first stage in parsing is throwing away what we don't need and cleaning up what we have. We can do quite a lot of this work directly in the grammar by defining actions, which will be performed on the result of the match. Actions are just bodies of JavaScript. To refer to items in the pattern, we prefix them with a name, followed by a colon:

Concept 										| Syntax 
--- 											| ---
Convert integer-string to number 				| ```n:[0-9] { return +n; }```
Get name in lowercase							| ```name:[a-zA-Z]+ { return name.join("").toLowerCase(); }```

**Moreover, colourless green ideas sleep furiously.** We might be able to *validate* the semantics from within the parser, but sometimes we need a secondary (or more) passes over the result.

#### Except, unless

For example, we want to match a variable name, except if it a reserved keyword. For example, 

```peg
varname "variable name" = !keyword word
```


### Common patterns

Just grab everything at the end of the document. (Notice the use of the $ prefix: this ensures we get the raw text back, rather than a huge array.)

```peg
end "end" = $.* 
```

To actually detect the end of the entire input string, we can assert that there is nothing after it:

```peg
end_of_input = !.
```

A variable name whose first character must be a letter, but subsequent characters can have underscores & numbers. 

```peg
id "id" = $([a-zA-Z] [a-zA-Z0-9_])*
```

Replacing newlines, quotes, and other magic characters to make sure you get a valid string back:

```peg
stringsafe "stringsafe"
 = text:string {
 	return text.replace(/\n/g, "\\n")
 			   .replace(/\r/g, "\\r")
 			   .replace(/\t/g, "\\t")
 			   .replace(/\f/g, "\\f")
 			   .replace(/\'/g, "\\'")
 			   .replace(/\"/g, '\\"')
 			   .replace(/\&/g, "\\&");
 }
```

Grabbing the text inside a string

```peg
string "string"	
 = '"' text:$(!'"' .)* '"' { return text; }
```

Many grammars use the _ underscore character to identify areas of whitespace, including spaces, tabs, newlines etc., as it draws more attention to the other, more significant parts of patterns. (except for languages in which white space is really significant...)

```peg
_ "optional whitespace"
= [ \t\r\n]*

__ "mandatory whitespace"
= [ \t\r\n]+
```

An example that shows how to detect nested structures. In this case, it will match "[x]", "[x[y]]", "[[x]y[z]]" etc., returning the result as properly nested arrays. This technique will also work for more complex delimiters, such as "/*" and "*/". 

```peg
// everything is either a bracketed fragment, or not:
Start        = Bracketed / NonBracketed

// a bracketed fragment is wrapped in [ and ]:
// we only need what is inside, and because of * it will be an array
Bracketed    = Open s:Start* Close { return s; }

// a non-bracketed fragment is any character that isn't [ or ]
// we only need the character, which because of . will match anything
// the !Open and !Close ensure that this character isn't [ or ]
NonBracketed = (!Open !Close c:.) { return c; }

// The opening & closing symbols of a bracket:
Open    = "["
Close   = "]"
```

```peg
// here's a simplified version, which grabs the text written inside /* long comments */
MultiLineComment = "/*" s:(!"*/" .)* "*/" { return s.join(""); }
```

#### Numbers

Here are a few patterns for whole numbers:

```peg
single_digit = [0-9]
nonzero_digit = [1-9]

nonzero_integer = nonzero_digit single_digit*
positive_integer = single_digit+
integer = "-"? positive_integer
```

Note that `positive_integer` above will match "0" but also "000"; if you don't want that, here's a refined version:

```peg
// won't match 000
positive_integer = "0" / (nonzero_digit single_digit*)
```

Introducing decimal points gets trickier, depending on how flexible you want to be. "1.2", "34.56", ".00001", "1234.", and negative versions of these? Scientific notation such as "1e10", "0.4e-12"? 

```peg
positive_decimal = ("." single_digit+)
	/ (single_digit+ "." single_digit*)	
	
decimal = "-"? positive_decimal

scientific = (decimal / integer) ("e" integer)?
```

If you want to turn these into actual numbers, rather than strings containing numbers:

```peg
number = scientific { return +text(); }
```

A compressed version of all this:

```peg
number = scientific { return +text(); }
scientific = "-"? (decimal / integer) ("e" "-"? integer)?
decimal = ("." integer) / (integer "." [0-9]*)
integer = [0-9]+
```



#### Notes and chords

How about turning typical note names and chords, such as "c4", "Fb5", "C#dim7" etc., into MIDI equivalents?

```peg
theory_note = c:chroma a:accidental? o:octave? {
	return c + (a || 0) + (o || 24);
}

chroma = c:[a-gA-G] { 
	// return MIDI note offset from C:
	switch(c.toUpperCase()) {
	case "C": return 0; break;
	case "D": return 2; break;
	case "E": return 4; break;
	case "F": return 5; break;
	case "G": return 7; break;
	case "A": return 9; break;
	case "B": return 11; break;
	}
}

// sharps and flats
accidental = a:[#b] {
	// return MIDI note offset:
	switch(a) {
    case "#": return +1;
    case "b": return -1;
    }
}

octave = "-"? [0-9] { 
	// MIDI note value of C in this octave:
	return 24 + (+text()) * 12; 
}

freq_note = n:number ("hz" / "Hz") {
	// the formula to turn Hz into MIDI note value:
    return 69 + 17.31234050465299 * Math.log(n / 440);
}

note = freq_note / theory_note
```

Now chords...

```peg

absolute_chord = base:note chord:chord_extended {
	var result = [];
    for (var e of chord) {
    	result.push(base + e);
    }
    return result;
}

chord_extended
= chord:chord ext:extensions* {
	var last = chord[2];
    for (var e of ext) {
    	chord.push(last + e);
    }
    return chord;
}

extensions 
= "7" { return 3; }
/ "#7" { return 4; }
/ "b9" { return 6; }
/ "9" { return 7; }

chord 
= "min" { return [0, 3, 7]; }
/ "maj" { return [0, 4, 7]; }
/ "dim" { return [0, 3, 6]; }
/ "sus" { return [0, 5, 7]; } 
/ "aug" { return [0, 4, 8]; }

```

### Common errors

#### "Infinite loop detected"

It's really easy to make a grammar that can never terminate. Here's a failed attempt to match a string of one or more "a" characters:

```peg
// BAD!!!
X = Y+
Y = "a"*  
```

The problem here is that Y can match nothing (the empty string), since it can match zero or more of something, and X can match one or more of these Y's. That is, X can match one or more nothings. If you think about it, there are an infinite number of times you can match nothing. So X will keep on matching nothing until you run out of memory, and the parser will give up in a poof of ennui.

All you need to do is make sure than under any array-like operation (i.e. any use of + or *), there is no expansion that can match an empty string (e.g. through the use of ? and *). 

So the above grammar can be fixed simply by moving the zero-or-more up to the top:

```peg
X = Y*
Y = "a"+ 
```

#### "Left recursion detected"

There's another common way to make a grammar that can't terminate. A really common example of this is handling math expressions. To match statements like "1", "1+2", "1+2+3" etc, it might be tempting to write this:

```peg
// BAD!!!
Expression = Addition / Value
Addition = Expression "+" Expression
Value = [0-9]
```

The problem is that the Addition rule's first item is Expression, whose first item is Addition, and so on forever -- the parser will keep following this trail of links until it runs out of memory, and never finish its job. 

An even simpler example:

```peg
StringOfAs = StringOfAs "a" / "a"
```

If you get the "Left recursion detected" error, look through each of your rules for their first (left-most) items, and make sure they can't resolve back to themselves. The math grammar above can be fixed by removing this feedback loop by changing the first item in the Addition rule as follows:

```peg
Expression = Addition / Value
Addition = Value ("+" Expression)*
Value = [0-9]
```

However note that the structure it returns will look different. We can use actions to reshuffle the parse tree into the format that we actually want.

---

### Nerdy FAQs

Why Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) rather than Context-Free Grammar (CFG)? Because the choice operator always selects the first match (in CFG this is ambiguous) -- with PEGs there is only one valid parse tree. Compared to Regular Expressions, PEGs have the ability to define recursive structures (and they're also a bit easier to read!)

## What can we do:

- make patterns
- manipulate patterns
- modulate
